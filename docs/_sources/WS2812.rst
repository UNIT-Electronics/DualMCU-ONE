   WS2812 LED Strip

Code Example
------------
Below is an example that demonstrates how to control WS1280 LED strips using the DualMCU ONE board:: 
    
    from machine import Pin
    from neopixel import NeoPixel
    np = NeoPixel(Pin(24), 1)
    np[0] = (255, 128, 0) # set to red, full brightness

    np.write()

..  tip::
    for more information on the NeoPixel library, refer to the `NeoPixel Library Documentation <https://github.com/lvidarte/esp8266/wiki/MicroPython:-NeoPixels>`_.

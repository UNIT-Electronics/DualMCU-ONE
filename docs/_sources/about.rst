DualMCU ONE 
==============================

Introduction
------------
The DualMCU ONE development board is a versatile platform that combines the power of two microcontrollers: the RP2040 and the ESP32. This combination allows developers to take advantage of the unique features and capabilities of each microcontroller, making it ideal for a wide range of applications.

.. warning::
  The DualMCU-ONE operates with 3.3V logic levels instead of the Arduino Unoâ€™s typical 5V.
  Make sure any shield or peripheral connected is compatible with 3.3V logic to avoid potential damage.
